Optimised Mathematical and Forecasting Model Of An ElectroMechanical Resonator
The escalating global concerns surrounding climate change and the depletion of fossil fuel reserves have intensified the exploration of sustainable energy alternatives. Among these alternatives, acoustic energy emerges as a promising yet underutilized resource with vast potential. This report delves into the intricate dynamics of harnessing acoustic energy through cutting-edge technologies such as piezoelectric transducers and acoustic panels. Despite its abundance in urban environments and industrial settings, tapping into acoustic energy faces formidable challenges. Existing solutions are hindered by inherent limitations, including constraints related to frequency dependence, operational adaptability, and scalability. Specifically, these solutions rely on materials with resonant frequencies that must closely match incoming sound waves for optimal energy conversion. This narrow frequency range restricts their versatility and efficiency, particularly in environments with diverse sound frequencies. Addressing these limitations is imperative to unlock the full potential of acoustic energy as a sustainable power source.

In response to these challenges, our methodology proposes a transformative approach centered around a sophisticated mathematical MATLAB model of an Electromechanical Helmholtz Resonator. This resonator represents a paradigm shift in acoustic energy harvesting technology by autonomously tuning its resonant frequency which is dependant on its geometry. This unique capability ensures that the resonator consistently operates at maximum efficiency, irrespective of changing ambient conditions. By dynamically adjusting its resonant frequency, the Electromechanical Helmholtz Resonator overcomes the limitations of traditional materials-based approaches, offering unparalleled adaptability and performance across a wide range of sound frequencies. Furthermore, our research endeavors encompass the development of a robust prediction model capable of accurately forecasting the power output generated by acoustic energy harvesting systems under fixed ambient conditions.

Our findings demonstrate a significant enhancement in energy harvesting efficiency with the implementation of our proposed methodology. We analyzed 100 minutes of audio files containing low-flying aircraft noises and 50 minutes of audio files containing noise recorded from a hospital corridor. We have compared the results of our tuned EMHR model with another model representing the existing solutions without tuning. The comparison reveals a notable increase by a factor of 2.933 * 10^6 in power generation when utilizing our tuned model, underscoring the efficacy and practical applicability of our approach in real-world acoustic energy harvesting scenarios.

We have adopted a code first approach and this repository contains all related '.m' code files, '.mat' workspaces and audio datasets we have used to train and test our forecasting model.
